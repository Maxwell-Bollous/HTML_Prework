                <h1>Professional Work</h1>
                <p>I have done several lower-grade jobs in acting over the past
                    few years. I even have an talent agent out of Boston you can visit <a href="https://www.modelclubinc.com/actors/men/maxwell-bollous">Here.</a>
                    I have been an extra on the show <em>Castle Rock,</em> as well as the movies <em>The Sleepover, Godmothered,</em>
                    and <em>Trip of a Lifetime.</em> I have done several commercials including a Verizon commercial as a 
                    principal role, and an ad for Hasbro Games for a Star Wars helmet they came out with.
