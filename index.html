                <p>My name is Maxwell Bollous. I am currently enrolled in this program at
                    Coding temple to hopefully get a stable job, and work with computers.
                    I am fascinated with how everything works inside of a computer, and it
                    always feels like solving the most incredible puzzle when you get your
                    code to work just right. I believe the route I would like to go is in 
                    web design. I plan to go to college soon and would like to design
                    websites to get some money as a part time job, and potentially turn
                    it into a full time job if everything works out correctly.

                <br>
                <p>In addition to coding, I have many other hobbies I like to enjoy.
                    Likely the thing I am most passionate about is the outdoors/nature.
                    I spend much of my freetime in the woods, having lived my life 
                    in rural New England. I have hiked as much as I could and studied
                    the local flora and fauna. In addition, I also have done some low level
                    acting and modeling, some of which you can find online. In the rest of my
                    free time it is not uncommon to find me playing video games, with RPGs being
                    my preferred source.
